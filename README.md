# govern

from Ancient Greek κυβερνάω (kubernáō, “I steer, drive, govern”)

This is a tool that figures out what I intend to do when working with a file in
vim. For example in ruby, I want to run rspec but in clojure test files I want
to evaluate the current file and additionally run tests if clojure.test is
required.
